cryptod is a program that listens on a TCP port or unix socket, receives
information on that port, and performs the requested action. Common
actions are aes256 encrypting/decrypting, base64 encoding/decoding,
and RMD160 hashing. Interfacing with the daemon is well documented,
and you are also easily able to obtain statistics from the server.

It is multi-threaded, can handle thousands of simultaneous connections, and
is Valgrind clean even after millions of transactions.

* To compile:
gcc -Wall -lc -Wextra -lcrypto -lpthread -lm -o cryptod crypto_server.c

* To run:
./cryptod -p 9997 -k /dev/random

* To encrypt:
printf "[ENCRYPT]\r\nHello, this is a test.\r\n.\r\n" | netcat localhost 9997

* To decrypt:
printf "[DECRYPT]\r\n<ENCRYPTED_TEXT>\r\n.\r\n" | netcat localhost 9997

* To use a typical daemon config:
dd if=/dev/random of=cryptod_secret_key.bin bs=1 count=1024
cryptod -u nobody -w -k cryptod_secret_key.bin -p 9997 -s
